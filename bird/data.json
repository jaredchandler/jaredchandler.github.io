In Canada it is found in far Western Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, and Yukon. It is black and white, with black areas on the wings and tail showing iridescent hints of blue or blue-green. It is one of only four North American songbirds whose tail makes up half or more of the total body length (the others being the yellow-billed magpie, the scissor-tailed flycatcher, and the fork-tailed flycatcher).\nThis species prefers generally open habitats with clumps of trees. It can therefore be found in farmlands and suburban areas, where it comes into regular contact with people. Where persecuted it becomes very wary, but otherwise it is fairly tolerant of human presence. Historically associated with bison herds, it now lands on the backs of cattle to clean ticks and insects from them. Large predators such as wolves are commonly followed by black-billed magpies, who scavenge from their kills. The species also walks on the ground, where it obtains such food items as beetles, grasshoppers, worms, and small rodents.\nThe black-billed magpie is one of the few North American birds that build a domed nest, which is made up of twigs and sits near the top of trees, and usually houses 6–7 eggs. Incubation, by the female only, starts when the clutch is complete, and lasts 16–21 days. The nestling period is 3–4 weeks.","color":"#ff6ad7","imageCredit":"Connormah","imageLicense":"CC BY-SA 3.0","imageLicenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0","__typename":"Species"},"count":247,"breakdown":{"unlikely":0,"uncertain":0,"veryLikely":0,"almostCertain":247,"__typename":"SpeciesCountBreakdown"},"averageProbability":0.29099999999999837,"__typename":"SpeciesCount"},{"speciesId":"14","species":{"id":"14","scientificName":"Passerella iliaca","commonName":"Fox Sparrow","thumbnailUrl":"https://birdweather.s3.amazonaws.com/species/14/FoxSparrow-thumbnail-c86a5d7b5f6abe6a77df79a61277d157.jpg","imageUrl":"https://birdweather.s3.amazonaws.com/species/14/FoxSparrow-standard-104b03b71c25af0f4fb59d141928f398.jpg","ebirdUrl":"https://ebird.org/species/foxspa","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_sparrow","wikipediaSummary":"The fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) is a large New World sparrow.

Violet-green swallows are secondary cavity nesters, found in a number of habitats including deciduous and coniferous forest. In addition to nesting in tree holes within these habitats, they are also widely observed nesting in the cracks of large cliffs.","color":"#009135","imageCredit":"\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/32541690@N02\"\u003eAlan Vernon\u003c/a\u003e","imageLicense":"CC BY 2.0","imageLicenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0","__typename":"Species"},"count":3,"breakdown":{"unlikely":0,"uncertain":0,"veryLikely":0,"almostCertain":3,"__typename":"SpeciesCountBreakdown"},"averageProbability":0.165,"__typename":"SpeciesCount"},{"speciesId":"75","species":{"id":"75","scientificName":"Corvus corax","commonName":"Common Raven","thumbnailUrl":"https://birdweather.s3.amazonaws.com/species/75/CommonRaven-thumbnail-2c59ac101721ffd18b9db239ccdb5e21.jpg","imageUrl":"https://birdweather.s3.amazonaws.com/species/75/CommonRaven-standard-386bb69ea0fe0f25cd2e5a84b04c792c.jpg","ebirdUrl":"https://ebird.org/species/comrav","wikipediaUrl":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_raven","wikipediaSummary":"The common raven (Corvus corax), also known as the western raven or  northern raven when discussing the raven at the subspecies level, is a large all-black   passerine bird. Found across the Northern Hemisphere, it is the most widely distributed of all corvids. There are at least eight subspecies with little variation in appearance, although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the thick-billed raven, and is possibly the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the common raven averages 63 centimetres (25 inches) in length and 1.2 kilograms (2.6 pounds) in mass. Although their typical lifespan is considerably shorter, common ravens can live more than 23 years in the wild, which among passerines only is surpassed by a few Australian species such as the satin bowerbird and probably the lyrebirds. Young birds may travel in flocks but later mate for life, with each mated pair defending a territory.\nCommon ravens have coexisted with humans for thousands of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as pests. Part of their success as a species is due to their omnivorous diet: they are extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, nesting birds, and food waste.\nSome notable feats of problem-solving provide evidence that the common raven is unusually intelligent. Over the centuries, it has been the subject of mythology, folklore, art, and literature. In many cultures, including the indigenous cultures of Scandinavia, ancient Ireland and Wales, Bhutan, the northwest coast of North America, and Siberia and northeast Asia, the common raven has been revered as a spiritual figure or godlike creature.","color":"#025fba","imageCredit":"\u003ca href=\"//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Drow_male\" title=\"User:Drow male\"\u003eDrow male\u003c/a\u003e","imageLicense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","imageLicenseUrl":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0","__typename":"Species"},"count":1,"breakdown":{"unlikely":0,"uncertain":0,"veryLikely":0,"almostCertain":1,"__typename":"SpeciesCountBreakdown"},"averageProbability":0.17800000000000002,"__typename":"SpeciesCount"}]}}
